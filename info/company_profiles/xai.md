## Overview

xAI is Elon Musk's AI venture, positioning Grok as a "truth-seeking" alternative to other AI assistants. The company is raising $15B at a ~$230B valuation (expected to close December 2025). xAI acquired X (Twitter) in March 2025 for $33B in an all-stock deal, integrating social media with AI. They operate Colossus, one of the world's largest AI supercomputers in Memphis with 200,000+ GPUs, and are planning expansion to 1 million GPUs.

## Products & Focus

Grok is the flagship chatbot, with Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy (multi-agent) released July 2025. Key products include SuperGrok subscriptions, Grok for Government (including a $200M DoD contract), and Grokipedia (Wikipedia competitor). Grok is integrated into Tesla vehicles and X Premium. The company focuses on real-time information access through X's data firehose and positions itself as less politically correct than competitors.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

xAI is notable for its breakneck infrastructure buildout and close ties to Musk's other companies (Tesla, SpaceX). They laid off 500 data annotation workers in September 2025, suggesting a shift in operations. Watch for: massive infrastructure/datacenter roles, government/defense positions, integration engineers for Tesla/X, and any safety roles (or lack thereof). Heavy hardware focus and government contracts differentiate them from pure-play AI labs. Controversy around content moderation issues may affect employer brand.
