# Fireworks AI

**Founded:** 2022 | **HQ:** Redwood City, CA | **ATS:** Greenhouse

## Overview

Fireworks AI is an inference cloud and infrastructure platform founded by the team behind PyTorch, led by CEO Lin Qiao. They raised $250M in October 2025 at a $4B valuation, led by Lightspeed, Index Ventures, and Evantic, bringing total funding to $327M. The platform powers 10,000+ companies and processes over 10 trillion tokens per day. ARR has surpassed $280M. Strategic investors include Nvidia, AMD, and Databricks.

## Products & Focus

Fireworks offers a generative AI platform-as-a-service with access to hundreds of open-source models (text, image, audio, multimodal), fine-tuning tools (LoRA, RLHF), and optimized inference infrastructure. Key differentiator is their focus on "product-model co-design" — enabling continuous improvement loops where user interactions feed back into model optimization. Major customers include Cursor, Uber, DoorDash, Notion, Shopify, Samsung, and Upwork.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Fireworks competes with Together AI, hyperscalers, and emerging inference providers. Their PyTorch heritage gives them deep systems expertise. Watch for: inference optimization engineers, systems researchers, enterprise sales (they're scaling sales/marketing teams), and data center operations (buying more GPUs). They announced plans to hire 150+ AI researchers and engineers with Series C funds. Any significant model development hiring (vs. pure infrastructure) would indicate strategic shift toward proprietary capabilities.
