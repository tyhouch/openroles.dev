# Anthropic

**Founded:** 2021 | **HQ:** San Francisco, CA | **ATS:** Greenhouse

## Overview

Anthropic is the safety-focused AI lab founded by former OpenAI researchers Dario and Daniela Amodei. As of September 2025, they've raised $13B at a $183B valuation, making them the third most valuable private company globally. Revenue grew from ~$1B at the start of 2025 to over $5B by August 2025 — one of the fastest-growing tech companies in history. They're projecting $70B revenue by 2028 and expect profitability around that time.

## Products & Focus

The Claude model family is their core product: Claude 4 Opus/Sonnet/Haiku with Claude Code being a massive breakout success (>$500M run-rate revenue by August 2025). 80% of revenue comes from business subscriptions. Key customers include Cursor, GitLab, GitHub (Claude in Copilot), and major enterprises. They've expanded Claude for Financial Services and launched Enterprise Search. Partnerships with Amazon (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure for distribution.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Anthropic differentiates on safety research (Constitutional AI, mechanistic interpretability) and enterprise-grade deployment. They're heavily coding/developer-focused — Claude Code's success makes this their primary growth engine. Watch for: interpretability/alignment research hires, enterprise sales expansion, Claude Code engineering, and international growth (new offices in Paris, Munich). Any departure from their safety-first positioning or aggressive consumer push would be anomalous.
