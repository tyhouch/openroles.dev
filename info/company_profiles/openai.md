# OpenAI

**Founded:** 2015 | **HQ:** San Francisco, CA | **ATS:** Ashby

## Overview

OpenAI is the dominant consumer AI company, with ChatGPT reaching 800 million weekly active users. Their flagship GPT-5 model family (released August 2025) unified their reasoning and chat capabilities into a single product line, eliminating the confusing model picker. The company has surpassed 1 million paying business customers and is reportedly targeting a $500 billion valuation.

## Products & Focus

Primary products include ChatGPT (consumer/enterprise), the GPT-5 model family via API, Codex CLI for agentic coding, Sora 2 for video generation, and AgentKit/ChatKit developer toolkits. OpenAI has been aggressively expanding into enterprise with ChatGPT Enterprise, integrations with Microsoft 365 Copilot, and GitHub Copilot. They acquired Windsurf (AI coding tool) for ~$3B in 2025.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

OpenAI's historical focus has been consumer-first with ChatGPT, but they're increasingly pushing into enterprise and developer tooling. Hiring signals to watch: enterprise sales expansion, agentic/agent infrastructure, video/multimodal teams, and hardware partnerships (the Jony Ive collaboration suggests potential device initiatives). Any significant safety team changes or reasoning research hires would also be notable given their competition with Anthropic on those fronts.
