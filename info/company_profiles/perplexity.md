# Perplexity

**Founded:** 2022 | **HQ:** San Francisco, CA | **ATS:** Ashby

## Overview

Perplexity is the AI-powered search startup challenging Google by providing conversational, cited answers to queries. Founded by Aravind Srinivas (ex-OpenAI, Google Brain, DeepMind) and team, they raised $200M at a $20B valuation in September 2025, with total funding exceeding $1.5B. The company processes 780 million queries monthly (30M+ daily) with 22 million monthly active users. ARR is approaching $200M with just 247 employees.

## Products & Focus

Core product is the Perplexity search engine with real-time citations. Subscription tiers include Pro ($20/month) and Max ($200/month). They launched Comet, an AI-native browser, in July 2025 (initially for Max subscribers, free download in October). Perplexity Assistant handles cross-app tasks. Shopping Hub (backed by Amazon/Nvidia) enables in-app purchasing. They've developed proprietary models (Sonar, R1 1776) based on Llama and DeepSeek.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Perplexity is the primary consumer alternative to Google Search in the AI era. They bid $34.5B for Chrome (rejected) and reportedly fielded acquisition interest from Apple. Watch for: search infrastructure engineers, publisher relations (they face copyright lawsuits from BBC, Dow Jones, NYT), monetization/ads roles, and Comet browser team expansion. Enterprise search capabilities and API expansion (Search API launched September 2025) indicate B2B ambitions. Any significant safety or content moderation hiring would address ongoing legal scrutiny.
