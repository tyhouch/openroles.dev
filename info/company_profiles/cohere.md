# Cohere

**Founded:** 2019 | **HQ:** Toronto, Canada | **ATS:** Ashby

## Overview

Cohere is the enterprise-focused LLM company founded by Aidan Gomez (co-author of the original Transformer paper "Attention Is All You Need"), Nick Frosst, and Ivan Zhang. They raised $600M in 2025 ($500M in August + $100M extension in September) at a $7B valuation. Revenue reached ~$150M ARR by October 2025. The company received $240M from the Canadian government as part of the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy.

## Products & Focus

Core models include Command A (generative), Embed 4 (retrieval), and Rerank 3.5. North is their flagship agentic AI platform for enterprise productivity, with North for Banking (RBC partnership) as a vertical-specific offering. Key differentiator is security-first, cloud-agnostic deployment — they can run on any cloud or on-premises. Major partners include Oracle, Dell, SAP, Fujitsu, LG CNS, Bell Canada, and Ensemble Health Partners. Hired Joelle Pineau (former Meta FAIR head) as Chief AI Officer in August 2025.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Cohere's niche is regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government) where data sovereignty and private deployment matter. They're explicitly not competing on consumer AI. Watch for: enterprise sales expansion (especially healthcare, financial services), on-premises deployment engineers, and vertical-specific product roles. The Joelle Pineau hire signals research ambitions — any significant research team expansion would be notable. Canadian government ties make federal/public sector roles important signals.
