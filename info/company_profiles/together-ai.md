# Together AI

**Founded:** 2022 | **HQ:** San Francisco, CA | **ATS:** Greenhouse

## Overview

Together AI is the leading inference cloud for open-source models, valued at $3.3B after raising $305M in February 2025. Founded by CEO Vipul Ved Prakash, with Chief Scientist Tri Dao (creator of FlashAttention). The company reached $100M ARR and serves 450,000+ developers and enterprises including Salesforce, Zoom, SK Telecom, and The Washington Post. They've secured 200 MW of power capacity and partnered with Hypertec for 36,000 NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 GPUs.

## Products & Focus

The Together AI Platform provides inference, fine-tuning, and training for 200+ open-source models across all modalities (text, image, audio, video, code, embeddings). Their proprietary Inference Engine delivers 2-3x faster performance than hyperscalers and 4x faster than vLLM. Key innovations include FlashAttention-3, Mixture of Agents, Medusa, and Sequoia. They're a primary provider for DeepSeek-R1 and Llama model deployment.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Together AI's thesis is that open-source models will converge with proprietary ones, making infrastructure the differentiator. They compete with hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and other inference providers (Fireworks, Baseten). Watch for: systems/ML infrastructure engineers, data center operations (they're building their own), kernel optimization specialists, and enterprise sales. Heavy research hiring (especially around efficiency/optimization) indicates continued investment in their technical moat. Any move into model training (vs. just inference) would be strategic expansion.
