# Mistral AI

**Founded:** 2023 | **HQ:** Paris, France | **ATS:** Lever

## Overview

Mistral is Europe's leading AI company and the primary open-source challenger to US labs. Founded by ex-DeepMind and Meta researchers (Arthur Mensch, Guillaume Lample, Timothée Lacroix), they raised €2B at a ~$14B valuation in September 2025, led by ASML. French President Macron has publicly endorsed Le Chat over ChatGPT. The company positions itself around European data sovereignty and regulatory compliance, making it attractive to EU governments and enterprises.

## Products & Focus

Model family includes Mistral Large 2, Mixtral (open-source MoE), Magistral (reasoning models, June 2025), Codestral/Devstral (coding), and Voxtral (audio). Le Chat is their consumer chatbot with a Pro tier at $14.99/month. Enterprise offerings include Mistral AI Studio and Mistral Code (vibe-coding client). Key partnerships include Microsoft Azure distribution, €100M deal with CMA CGM, and French military/government deployments. Revenue projected ~€60M in 2025.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Mistral differentiates on open-source models, European sovereignty, and efficiency. They're expanding a Palo Alto office to compete in Silicon Valley and building data centers near Paris. Watch for: open-source model researchers, European enterprise sales, regulatory/compliance roles, and multilingual specialists. Any shift away from open-source licensing or European focus would be anomalous. Competition with US labs for talent is intense — hiring patterns reveal whether they're winning that battle.
