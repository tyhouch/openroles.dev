# Scale AI

**Founded:** 2016 | **HQ:** San Francisco, CA | **ATS:** Greenhouse

## Overview

Scale AI is the dominant data labeling and AI infrastructure company, valued at $29B after Meta's $14.3B investment for a 49% stake in June 2025. Founder Alexandr Wang took a position at Meta overseeing "superintelligence" strategy, with Jason Droege (ex-Uber) becoming interim CEO. The company generated ~$2B in revenue in 2025 and serves as a critical layer in the AI stack — providing training data for OpenAI, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and others.

## Products & Focus

Core offerings include data labeling through Remotasks (computer vision, autonomous vehicles) and Outlier (LLM/RLHF work with expert annotators), the Scale Data Engine for end-to-end data management, and Donovan for federal/defense applications. Major government contracts include a $250M DoD deal and the Thunderforge project for military AI planning. They're a third-party evaluator for the US AI Safety Institute.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Scale AI is uniquely positioned at the intersection of commercial AI and defense. The Meta deal may shift their independence — Google has indicated plans to cut ties. Watch for: RLHF/data annotation specialists, defense/federal roles, and any changes in their commercial client-facing teams post-Meta. Labor practice investigations by the DOL and lawsuits over contractor classification could affect hiring patterns in their workforce operations. Any reduction in federal/government roles would be significant given their defense positioning.
