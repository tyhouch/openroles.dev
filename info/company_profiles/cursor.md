# Cursor (Anysphere)

**Founded:** 2022 | **HQ:** San Francisco, CA | **ATS:** Ashby

## Overview

Anysphere is the company behind Cursor, the fastest-growing SaaS product ever by some measures. Founded by four MIT graduates, they reached $1B+ ARR by November 2025 and raised $2.3B at a $29.3B valuation. Earlier rounds included $900M at $9.9B (June 2025) led by Thrive Capital, with Andreessen Horowitz, Accel, DST Global, Nvidia, and Google participating. The company has 300+ employees and over 1 million daily active users.

## Products & Focus

Cursor is an AI-native code editor built on VS Code that integrates AI throughout the development workflow. Key features include Agent Mode (autonomous coding), Codebase Chat (repo-wide understanding), and proprietary Cursor-Fast models. The product popularized "vibe coding" — a term coined by Andrej Karpathy to describe fluid, AI-assisted programming. Users include engineering teams at Stripe, Shopify, OpenAI, and Instacart.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Cursor is the breakout winner in AI coding tools, competing with GitHub Copilot (~$500M revenue) and Claude Code (~$500M+ revenue). OpenAI attempted to acquire them but was rejected — they later bought Windsurf instead. Watch for: AI research (they're building proprietary models), VS Code/IDE engineers, enterprise sales (14K enterprise customers as of April 2025), and any expansion beyond coding. Their ARR doubled every ~2 months through mid-2025 — hiring velocity should reflect that growth. Competition for AI coding talent is fierce across OpenAI, Anthropic, and GitHub.
