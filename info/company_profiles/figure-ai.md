# Figure AI

**Founded:** 2022 | **HQ:** Sunnyvale, CA | **ATS:** Greenhouse

## Overview

Figure AI is building general-purpose humanoid robots for commercial and eventually consumer applications. Founded by Brett Adcock (also founded Archer Aviation, Vettery), they raised $675M in February 2024 at $2.6B from OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, and Jeff Bezos. As of early 2025, they were in talks to raise $1.5B at a potential $40B valuation. They ended their OpenAI collaboration in 2025, stating LLMs are "getting smarter yet more commoditized."

## Products & Focus

Current robots include Figure 02 (deployed at BMW) and the newer Helix model with 35 degrees of freedom and Helix VLA (vision-language-action neural network). Figure 03 was introduced October 2025. BotQ is their manufacturing facility targeting 12,000 humanoids per year. Primary customer is BMW's Spartanburg plant where they completed an 11-month pilot project. The company targets logistics, warehousing, and manufacturing before eventual household applications.

## Strategic Context for Hiring Analysis

Figure is in the capital-intensive early commercialization phase of humanoid robotics. The BMW partnership is their proof point but remains limited in scope (single robot performing single tasks). Watch for: robotics engineers, AI/ML for embodied agents, manufacturing/operations roles for BotQ scaling, and enterprise sales. Any significant hiring in household/consumer applications would signal timeline acceleration. Hardware reliability and mechanical engineering roles indicate production scale-up. Competition from Tesla Optimus, Agility Robotics, and others is intensifying.
